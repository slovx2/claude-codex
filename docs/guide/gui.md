# Using the Codex App

Once the shim and exports are installed and the adapter is built:

1. In **Codex App**, add a Remote connection to the host (or `localhost`). The
   app runs its native SSH probe and bootstrap; the shim routes `codex
   app-server` into the adapter.
2. Start a thread and send a prompt. Claude Code runs the turn:
   - Agent text and reasoning stream into the conversation.
   - `Bash` calls surface as Codex **command approvals**.
   - `Edit` / `Write` / `MultiEdit` surface as **file-change approvals** with a
     live diff.
3. Approve actions in the Codex App UI as usual.
4. Disconnecting closes the proxy. Once no turn is active, the daemon idles out
   and the in-process Claude runtime is reclaimed.

## Picking a model

Codex App's model menu stays a **model selector** only — pick `Claude Sonnet`,
`Claude Opus`, `Claude Fable`, `Claude Haiku`, etc. The active Claude Code **route**
(which backend serves the turn) is chosen outside the App with the shim mode; see
[Backends](/guide/backends).

The default picker exposes Claude Code aliases; model availability and the version
an alias selects depend on your account, provider, and Claude Code version. The
list is not an account entitlement check. `CHA_CLAUDE_MODELS` replaces the
default Claude list when you need to customize it.

**Claude Opus Plan / Sonnet Execute** keeps the `opus-plan` option ID and maps to Claude
Code's `opusplan` hybrid mode: Opus during planning, Sonnet during execution.
Selecting it does not itself enable plan mode, so an ordinary conversation may
correctly run on Sonnet. Choose **Claude Opus** to use Opus throughout. See the
[Claude Code model configuration](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/model-config#opusplan-model-setting).

## Localhost GUI testing on macOS

For localhost GUI testing, the adapter is launched by SSH and the in-process TS
runtime invokes the Claude Code CLI directly — no external daemon to manage. Put
these lightweight exports in `~/.zshenv`:

```bash
REPO="$HOME/path/to/codex-harness-adapter"
export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"
export CHA_CLAUDE_ADAPTER="$REPO/packages/claude/dist/claude/src/adapter.mjs"
export CHA_CLAUDE_NODE="$(command -v node)"
export CHA_CLAUDE_CLI="$(command -v claude)"
export CODEX_REAL="$(command -v codex)"
```

`npm run acceptance:gui-ssh-localhost` drives this exact path end-to-end (real
daemon + proxy over SSH, real Claude turn, approval bridge, diff events) and is
the closest automated check to the GUI Remote experience.
